# Sandstorm

Sandstorm makes it easy to run your own server.

Drew is testing Jenkins.

Use Sandstorm to install apps to create [documents](http://etherpad.org/),
[spreadsheets](https://ethercalc.net/), [blogs](https://wordpress.org),
[git repos](https://about.gitlab.com/), [task lists](http://wekan.io), and
[more](https://apps.sandstorm.io/) as easily as you'd install apps on your
phone.

Sandstorm is open source and can be installed on any x86-64 Linux
system.

## Caveats

Sandstorm is in early beta. Lots of features are not done yet, and more review
needs to be done before relying on it for mission-critical tasks.
That said, we use it ourselves to get work done every day, and we hope you'll
find it useful as well.
