# This file defines Cap'n Proto interfaces for TCP/IP networking.
#
# The purpose of these interfaces is to implement "driver" applications -- that is, apps which
# themselves implement raw legacy network protocols (e.g. HTTP, SMTP, XMPP, etc.) and then
# re-export those protocols as a Cap'n Proto interface with meaningful separation of capabilities.
# Driver applications generally must be "approved by the Sandstorm administrator" because raw
# network access can be abused in ways that harm the server as a whole. For example, an app which
# secretly sends spam via SMTP or engages in piracy via Bittorrent could harm the server's
# reputation, not just the user's.
#
# In practice, a driver app is technically just a regular application that makes a Powerbox request
# for raw network access (represented by the interfaces defined in this file). Only the server
# administrator normally possesses these capabilities, therefore only the administartor can
# normally authorize such apps.
#
# Of course, a regular user could run a driver app and connect it to fake networking capabilities,
# e.g. for the purpose of testing, or for use over a fake IP network that only connects to other
# Sandstorm apps.
#
# For simplicity in porting legacy apps, sandstorm-http-bridge can optionally be configured to
# act as an IP proxy, allowing legacy apps to transparently use IP networking via the standard
# socket API.

  #
  # As always with UDP, successful return does not indicate successful delivery. On the receiving
  # end, a message may be delivered multiple times and/or may be truncated. It is the app's
  # responsibility to deal with ACKs, timeouts, message ordering, de-duplification, and data
  # integrity.
  #
  # `returnPort` may be used to send a direct reply. On the sending side, if the datagram is sent as
  # a real UDP packet, `returnPort` will be bound to an ephemeral port for a short time to receive
  # this reply. If `returnPort` is already bound to a port (either explicitly, or because it was
  # used in a previous `sendDatagram` call), then IP bridge implementation will reuse that binding
  # rather than allocate a new one. Therefore, frequently sending datagrams with the same
  # `returnPort` should have the effect of keeping the real IP address/port constant (this is
  # analogous to how NATs typically handle UDP traffic).
  #
  # TODO(someday): Cap'n Proto should support marking methods as "fast-but-unreliable", with all
  #   the properties of UDP. Then, this method should be marked as such.

  #
  # If possible, design your app so that the powerbox interaction is the point where the hostname
  # is specified in the first place. For example, if your app asks the user to specify a host to
  # connect to, and then immediately makes a powerbox request for that host, consider instead not
  # asking the user for a hostname at all and instead making the Powerbox request right off and
  # letting the user specify the hostname there.
