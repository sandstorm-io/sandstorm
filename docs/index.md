## What is Sandstorm? See [sandstorm.io](https://sandstorm.io)

Sandstorm is a self-hostable web productivity suite. It's implemented as a security-hardened web app package manager.

Sandstorm lets you run your own server and install apps like
[EtherCalc](https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/a0n6hwm32zjsrzes8gnjg734dh6jwt7x83xdgytspe761pe2asw0), [GitLab](https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/zx9d3pt0fjh4uqrprjftgpqfwgzp6y2ena6098ug3ctv37uv6kfh), [Etherpad](https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/h37dm17aa89yrd8zuqpdn36p6zntumtv08fjpu8a8zrte7q1cn60), [Wekan](https://apps.sandstorm.io/app/m86q05rdvj14yvn78ghaxynqz7u2svw6rnttptxx49g1785cdv1h), and more as easily as you'd
install apps on your phone. Sandstorm handles login & access control,
and can run any web app that runs on Linux, though some apps may need
changes to work within the Sandstorm sandbox.

Sandstorm is very new and a lot of features have yet to be developed;
however, many people are already using it for real work every day.
