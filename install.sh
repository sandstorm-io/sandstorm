#! /bin/bash

# This script installs the Sandstorm Personal Cloud Server on your Linux
# machine. You can run the latest installer directly from the web by doing:
#
#     curl https://install.sandstorm.io | bash
#
# If `curl|bash` makes you uncomfortable, see other options here:
#
#     https://docs.sandstorm.org/install/
#
# This script only modifies your system in the following ways:
# - Install Sandstorm into the directory you choose, typically /opt/sandstorm.
# - Optionally add an initscript or systemd service:
#     /etc/init.d/sandstorm
#     /etc/systemd/system/sandstorm.service
# - Add commands "sandstorm" and "spk" to /usr/local/bin.
#
# Once installed, you may uninstall with the command: sandstorm uninstall
#
# The script will ask you whether you're OK with giving it root privileges.
# If you refuse, the script can still install Sandstorm (to a directory you
# own), but will not be able to install the initscript or shortcut commands,
# and the dev tools will not work (due to limitations with using FUSE in a
# sandbox).
#
# This script downloads and installs binaries. This means that to use this
# script, you need to trust that the authors are not evil, or you must use
# an isolated machine or VM. Of course, since the Sandstorm authors'
# identities are widely known, if they did try to do anything evil, you
# could easily get them arrested. That said, if you'd rather install from
# 100% auditable source code, please check out the Github repository instead.
#
# All downloads occur over HTTPS from Sandstorm's servers and are further
# verified using PGP.

    # would temporarily block new installs. Surprisingly (to me, at least), whenever this happend,
    # people would actually notice and complain within a day or two -- people were apparently
    # still installing Sandstorm regularly.
    #
    # As of Feb 2023, though, I think it's time to retire this check and end the monthly update
    # schedule, for several reasons:
    # - In 2022, the majority of months saw no actual changes at all.
    # - Ian, who had been the most active maintainer, is now focusing his efforts on a new
    #   implementation called Tempest. So 2023 is likely to see even fewer changes.
    # - It's no longer possible to update the Meteor dependency, because newer versions of Meteor
    #   no longer support the ancient version of Mongo we're stuck on (2.6), and writing automation
    #   to update everyone's Mongo instances automatically without breaking anyone is too large
    #   a project for anyone to volunteer for. Since almost all of Sandstorm's dependencies stem
    #   from Meteor, trying to update dependencies on a monthly basis has become futile, as the
    #   pinned Meteor version holds everything else back.
    # - I just have too much to do, and although releases are not a whole lot of work, it feels
    #   like one more thing on the pile.
