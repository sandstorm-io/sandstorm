# Sandstorm documentation

## What is Sandstorm? See [sandstorm.io](https://sandstorm.io)

Sandstorm is an open source platform for personal servers.

Sandstorm lets you run your own server and install apps like
EtherCalc, GitLab, Etherpad, Wekan, and more as easily as you'd
install apps on your phone. Sandstorm handles login & access control,
and can run any web app that runs on Linux, though some apps may need
changes to work within the Sandstorm sandbox.

Sandstorm is very new and a lot of features have yet to be developed.
But, many people are already using it for real work every day.
