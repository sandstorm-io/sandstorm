<h1>Sandstorm Style Guide</h1>

<p>(Work in progress.)This style guide is intended to be used as a reference guide as well as a source for re-using existing elements. The aim is to maintain consistent styling while improving reusability and simplifying future CSS changes.</p>

<h2>Typography</h2>
  <h3>Headings</h3>
    <h1>H1 heading</h1>
      <p class="details1">To be used for page titles. E.g. "Sandstorm Style Guide".</p>
    <h2>H2 heading</h2>
      <p class="details1">To be used as headers on a page. E.g. "Typography". </p>
    <h3>H3 heading</h3>
      <p class="details1">To be used as subheadings on a page. E.g. "Body Text". </p>
    <h4>H4 heading</h4>
    <h5>H5 heading</h5>
    <h6>H6 heading</h6>
  <h3>Body Text</h3>
  <p>This is example body text. Sandstorm.io is an open source hosting platform for personal/private instances of web apps. Users can upload and install arbitrary software through a simple app-store-like web interface.</p>
  <p class="details1">Body text should be specified using the p tag in most cases.</p>
  <h3>Details Text</h3>
    <p class="details1">This is example details text. The Sandstorm implementation is copyright by Sandstorm Development Group, Inc. and contributors. The implementation is licensed under the Apache License 2.0.</p>
    <p class="details1">Use details text styling for cases where text is considered "additional information" and not required to be read for most users to succeed at their task.</p>
<h2>Buttons</h2>
  <p>Styling a button as primary, secondary, or tertiary is dependent on the context of what UI is being shown at the time. When deciding on what styling to apply to each button, think of the action relative to other actions that are visible in that specific UI. The same action might be styled as a primary button in some cases and a secondary button or tertiary button in other cases.</p>
  <h3>Primary</h3>
    <button class="button-primary1" href="#">Small</button>
    <button class="button-primary2" href="#">Regular</button>
    <button class="button-primary3" href="#">Large</button>
    <button class="button-primary4" href="#">X-Large</button>
    <p class="details1">Use primary button styling for buttons that are the preferred action. E.g. "Save" or "Continue" would likely be primary actions versus "Cancel" or "Back".</p>
  <h3>Secondary</h3>
    <button class="button-secondary1" href="#">Small</button>
    <button class="button-secondary2" href="#">Regular</button>
    <button class="button-secondary3" href="#">Large</button>
    <button class="button-secondary4" href="#">X-Large</button>
    <p class="details1">Use secondary button styling...</p>
  <h3>Tertiary</h3>
    <button class="button-tertiary1" href="#">Small</button>
    <button class="button-tertiary2" href="#">Regular</button>
    <button class="button-tertiary3" href="#">Large</button>
    <button class="button-tertiary4" href="#">X-Large</button>
  <h3>Disabled</h3>
    <button disabled class="button-primary1" href="#">Small</button>
    <button disabled class="button-primary2" href="#">Regular</button>
    <button disabled class="button-primary3" href="#">Large</button>
    <button disabled class="button-primary4" href="#">X-Large</button>
